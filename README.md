P.O.P.S. Custom Browser: a custom web browser engine with a GUI built using HTML, JavaScript, and P5.js. This would focus on parsing, scraping, interpreting, and displaying web content—including images and videos—while leveraging the host browser's built-in APIs (like DOM parsing, fetch for resource grabbing, and media elements for playback).
